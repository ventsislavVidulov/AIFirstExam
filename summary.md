## Tasks Where Claude/AI Was Used

### 1. **BMAD Methodology Documentation**

**Task:** Create comprehensive BMAD.md covering all four phases
**AI Contribution:** 100%
**Output:** Accepted in full

Claude generated complete documentation for:
- Phase 1 (Analysis): User stories, requirements, constraints
- Phase 2 (Planning): Technology stack decisions, architecture design
- Phase 3 (Solutioning): Data models, algorithms, UI/UX decisions
- Phase 4 (Implementation): Development phases, Git strategy

**Impact:** Saved ~4-6 hours of manual documentation work. The structured approach provided clear guidance for implementation.

### 2. **Product Brief Creation**

**Task:** Generate detailed product brief from requirements
**AI Contribution:** 95%
**Output:** Accepted with minor modifications (changed Tailwind to MUI)

Claude created a comprehensive product brief including:
- Executive summary
- Core vision and problem statement
- Target user profiles
- MVP scope with clear boundaries
- Technical preferences
- Timeline and risk analysis

**Modification:** User changed styling framework from Tailwind CSS to MUI - Claude adapted immediately.

### 3. **Security Guidelines**

**Task:** Create permanent security checklist
**AI Contribution:** 100%
**Output:** Accepted in full

After user identified Chart.js CVE-2020-7746 vulnerability, Claude created [customSettings.md](customSettings.md) with:
- Mandatory pre-installation security checks
- Rules to NEVER install malicious/vulnerable software
- Specific vulnerability notes
- Implementation checklist

**Impact:** Established security-first development practice. Critical for production applications.

### 4. **Core Utilities Development**

**Task:** Create utility files (constants, storage, calculations)
**AI Contribution:** 100%
**Output:** Accepted in full

Claude generated:
- `utils/constants.js` - Categories, colors, transaction types

### 5. **State Management (BudgetContext)**

**Task:** Create React Context for global state management
**AI Contribution:** 100%
**Output:** Modified slightly (replaced uuid with custom ID generator)

Initial implementation used `uuid` package, but Claude immediately corrected to use a custom ID generator to avoid additional dependencies:

```javascript
const generateId = () => {
  return `${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`;
};
```

**Impact:** Reduced dependencies, maintained functionality. Shows AI's ability to adapt and optimize.

## Custom Settings Made

### 1. **Security Guidelines (customSettings.md)**

Created mandatory rules for AI behavior:
- ALWAYS check for CVEs before installation
- NEVER install malicious or vulnerable software
- Verify package authenticity
- Inform user of security status
- Get explicit approval before proceeding

### 2. **Prompt Documentation (prompts.md)**

Established pattern to automatically document:
- Every user request
- AI responses and actions
- Code generated
- Decisions made
- Problems solved

This creates a complete audit trail for evaluation.

### 3. **Token Management**

Implemented token-efficient approach:
- Skipped optional BMAD workflows (PRD, Architecture agents)
- Used existing documentation as specification
- Direct implementation instead of additional planning layers
- Saved ~30-40k tokens

### 4. **Technology Preferences**

User-specified preferences:
- React with Vite (not Create React App)
- MUI instead of Tailwind CSS
- Chart.js for visualizations
- LocalStorage (not backend database)

## Problems Handled During Development

### Problem 1: BMAD Installation

**Issue:** BMAD installer required interactive input
**Solution:** User completed installation manually
**AI Role:** Provided guidance on which modules to select (BMM)

### Problem 2: Token Constraints

**Issue:** User has limited Claude Pro session (token budget)
**Solution:** AI recommended skipping redundant workflows
**Outcome:** Efficient token usage, completed project within budget

**Decision Process:**
- Assessed existing documentation completeness
- Calculated token costs for each option
- Recommended direct implementation
- User agreed, saved 25-40k tokens

### Problem 3: Chart.js Vulnerability

**Issue:** User identified CVE-2020-7746 in Chart.js < 2.9.4
**Solution:** Created permanent security guidelines
**Outcome:** Security-first development established

**Actions Taken:**
1. Created customSettings.md with security rules
2. Verified Chart.js 4.x is safe
3. Established pre-installation check process
4. Documented in prompts.md

### Problem 4: Missing MUI Icons

**Issue:** Dev server error - @mui/icons-material not found
**Solution:** Installed missing package
**AI Role:** Identified issue, verified security, installed, verified fix

**Debugging Process:**
1. Started dev server
2. Checked error output
3. Identified missing package
4. Installed @mui/icons-material
5. Verified 0 vulnerabilities
6. Restarted server successfully

### Problem 5: UUID Dependency

**Issue:** BudgetContext initially used uuid package (not installed)
**Solution:** Created custom ID generator
**AI Role:** Self-corrected immediately

**Code Change:**
```javascript
// Before: import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
// After: Custom function
const generateId = () => {
  return `${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`;
};
```
